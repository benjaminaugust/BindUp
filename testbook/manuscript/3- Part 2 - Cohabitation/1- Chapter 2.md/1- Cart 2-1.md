She steps lightly into his room, kneading her gloved hands and craning her neck and looking around like a drug fiend dying for another fix. There are guards posted at each side of the door, but their eyes are fixed forward as if painted on, and if either of them heard or saw her she has no proof of it.
She looks around. A blanket is scattered halfway off his bed, and a half-eaten meal is congealing in pooled gravy on a golden plate like ruptured organs on an operating table. There are unrolled scrolls on the table beside the food, but they’re stained through with dots of grease, and some of them are covered in patterns of colorful sauce like paint on an artist’s palette. The drapes on the window are half open and the window itself is half open, and through that gap she sees people on rooftops dancing like primitive worshipers begging for rain.
Anyone who didn’t know the man might wonder what calamity had befallen him. But Rial has served people like him long enough to know the habits of the elite.
She looks to the left and finds him where he always is when his room is in shambles—standing over his game board and holding the tang he uses to manipulate the pieces. It’s a hexagonal board with over one hundred tiles, and the pieces have been cut from gemstones, and there are three colors with twelve pieces each. By now the game position is a hectic mess with pieces in places they could never have ended up had he been playing a match with two actual opponents; but that’s exactly why the General never plays real matches—he can only smile at the board once it’s completely unmanageable.
“Sir,” she says in a hushed voice that even she can barely hear, but General Keeve puts up a hand, his long forefinger out as if testing the wind.
He squats beside the game board and studies it with pouting lips. He wears leather armor dyed black, and he keeps his sword strapped horizontally across his lower back, and the lamplight coming off the walls paints a yellow sheen on the crown of his hairless head.
He positions the tang in his closed fist like a javelin, and he slowly pushes one of the pieces across the board away from where the others are jumbled.
“Sir,” she says again, and when he doesn’t silence her, she pushes on, saying, “Have you seen Dankar, sir?”
He glances at her briefly, and then he looks back at the board, holds his gaze there for a second and then looks up at her again. She’s used to this double-take by now. Though her complexion is convincingly Cribdahlian, her eyes are not cut from gold but emerald, and her hair is not dark like the night but red like the sand, cut thick and short. She has encountered other dark foreigners in Cribdahl, and she has seen them all receive the same treatment.
“Do I know you?” Keeve asks.
“I’ve… been your maid for a few weeks now, sir.”
He grunts and studies the board again. “I get distracted sometimes—you understand. There’s a civil—”
“Civil war going on,” Rial says, finishing his sentence for him and smiling. “I’ve heard. Many times.”
When he looks at her again, he isn’t smiling.
She frowns.
“But no blood has been shed yet,” she reminds him, “and we’re still in an armistice until the end of the Grand Festival. That’s months away, sir. Why preoccupy yourself so much when you could be relaxing?”
He looks at the board again and starts adjusting the little statuettes on their tiles with the tang. “For that very reason,” he mutters in a growling voice. There’s a miniature sapphire statuette of an archer mounted on the back of a pif cat mid-stride. Keeve pushes it a few tiles in one direction, and then he slides it laterally another direction. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand this,” he goes on, “but the armistice is exactly what bothers me.” He moves an emerald statuette of an old man dressed in an intricate bilta and holding a scepter like Patriarch Newal.
Then he stops for a moment and looks away at a corner of the room as if he sees something cowering there, withering under his gaze.
“You see,” he says, pushing the tang at the board without looking, “the players have walked away from the game—” he slides the mounted archer back laterally, and then scoops the tang around behind it and pulls it back to its original place “—but the pieces are still moving—” he pushes the Patriarch figurine until it’s up against the mounted archer “—as if—” he looks up at the ceiling “—as if controlled by some unseen will.” He knocks the pieces into each other, and they topple, knocking over a third and a fourth and a fifth, which spirals on the floor like a break dancer.
“Like a hurricane,” he continues. “A natural destroyer that fools think comes from nowhere and fades into nothing, but that the educated realize is an effect playing out from some faraway cause.” He looks at the board again. “For the former, the hurricane will come once, and then it’ll come again, and then it’ll come again and again. But for the latter, the hurricane will come once, and then it’ll never come again, because the latter will divert the winds and the rain to the former, and the former will accept this all as poor luck.”
Rial stares down at the General. “You think you’re being manipulated, sir?”
“Manipulated? No.” He doesn’t even bother to look at her. “Anyway, what was it you wanted?”
She laughs nervously. “I’m… looking for Dankar.”
“I believe he’s still in cart forty-two putting on a show.”
“Okay,” she says in an exhaled breath, and when she turns to go the General calls for her to stop. She turns around. “Yes si—”
“Why’re you wearing gloves?” Keeve asks. He has already risen and come to her, and now he takes her by the hand. Before she can speak, he pulls one long glove off of her and lets it dangle between his pinched fingers.
Her hand is exposed. It’s covered entirely in a black substance as shiny as oil and as thick as milk that continues up into her sleeve and further across her body, beyond sight.
She snatches the glove from him, saying, “I’ve been burned sir!” and hurrying to put it back on with shaking hands.
“Burned?” He pulls back as if he thinks burns are contagious.
“My whole arm,” she says.
He leans forward and peeks down the collar of her bilta and says, “And your chest? And your neck, too?”
She puts a hand over her collar, and her cheeks heat up.
“Burned terribly it seems,” he says. “And your cheek.” He reaches out and touches the birthmark on her face—a big, ugly splotch of black skin, coarse and disfiguring, but in no way related to what covers her arms and torso.
She puts a hand on her cheek and gently brushes his fingers away.
“It still hurts,” he says.
“It does, sir,” she says with eyes averted.
“A cripple like you really shouldn’t be working—”
“I’ll be off,” she says brusquely, and then she turns to go before he can say anything else. She half expects him to berate her for being so curt, so she walks even faster, passing between the two emotionless guards into the long hallway.
“Wait,” he calls after her, voice booming against the walls like a boulder.
She hurries through the hall past closed off rooms and cuts into one that’s open and closes the door, hoping the General hasn’t seen where she’s gone.
She leans her back to that ebony and listens for a long time.
